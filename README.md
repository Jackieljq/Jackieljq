## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am **Jiaqi (Jackie) Li**, a software engineer with a strong background in **full-stack development, backend engineering, API design, cloud computing, and financial technology**.

Before my master's degree, I worked as an **R&D Engineer at Shenzhen Huaji Technology**, focusing on:

- Base station **OAM software development**
- Windows desktop & Web UI development (Python, PyQt, JS/TS, React)
- Debugging, system upgrades & API-based system integration  
- SSH automation & base station server API operations

Combined with my **finance undergraduate background**, I bring a strong analytical mindset plus the ability to create efficient, data-driven and production-ready software solutions.

I enjoy building:  
✔ backend systems  
✔ real-time apps  
✔ cloud-native services  
✔ data-driven dashboards  
✔ automation tools
